# GPLs-FG-TPMS-Plates-NSGT
This repository provides the basic source code of the investigation on the behaviors of graphene platelets (GPLs)-reinforced funtionally graded triply periodic minimal surface (FG-TPMS) nanoplates with the following features:
- Integrating nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient effects;
- Combining three TPMS architectures with two porosity distribution patterns and three GPLs distribution patterns;
- Seven-variable plate model, higher-order shear deformation theory, isogeometric analysis; 
- Static bending and free vibration responses.
